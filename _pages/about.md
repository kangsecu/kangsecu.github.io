I am a Ph.D. student in Network Convergence & Security Lab([MMLab](https://mmlab.snu.ac.kr/)), Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University. I am advised by Prof. Taekyoung (Ted) Kwon.

My research interests primarily lie in AI Security and Privacy-Preserving Applications. More specifically, I focus on security in distributed learning environments, as well as privacy protection within network and web environments.
