I am a Ph.D. student in **Network Convergence & Security Laboratory**([MMLAB](https://mmlab.snu.ac.kr/)), Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University. 
I am advised by Prof. [Taekyoung (Ted) Kwon](https://mmlab.snu.ac.kr/~tk/).

My research interests primarily lie in **AI Security** and **Application Privacy**. More specifically, I focus on security in distributed learning environments, as well as privacy protection within network and web environments.

In addition to security research, I have a strong passion for **hacking** and **CTFs**, with a primary focus on web hacking. I am currently an active member of [RubiyaLab](https://rubiyalab.team/), participating in various CTF competitions. I also serve as a subcommittee member for the Hacking Organization Research Group at the [Korean National Police Agency](https://www.police.go.kr/index.do)
